# My Scripts #
* `cleanup-git.sh`  
  Interactively asks if you wish to delete remote branches and branches of the
  same name locally. Can provide branch info to help make the decision.  
  `--local` will repeat the process for your local-only branches afterwards
  Can be configured in the script to change the default upstream
  (upstream/master) and remote (origin).
